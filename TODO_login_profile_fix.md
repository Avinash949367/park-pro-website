# TODO: Fix Login Profile Display

## Tasks
- [x] Modify frontend/js/auth.js to set 'isLoggedIn' flag in localStorage after successful login
- [x] Ensure logout functionality in index.html clears the 'isLoggedIn' flag
- [ ] Test login flow to verify profile icon appears and links to userprofile.html
- [ ] Verify mobile profile display works correctly

## Information Gathered
- index.html has login button and hidden profile container with user icon
- JavaScript checks localStorage 'isLoggedIn' to toggle visibility
- auth.js sets 'token', 'user', 'email' but not 'isLoggedIn' after login
- Profile icon is already linked to userprofile.html
- Logout removes 'isLoggedIn' but since it's not set, need to ensure consistency

## Dependent Files
- frontend/js/auth.js
- frontend/index.html

## Followup Steps
- Test login and logout flow
- Ensure mobile version displays profile correctly
