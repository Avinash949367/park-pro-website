# Fix Station Settings Errors

## Problem
- station_settings.js:51 Error loading settings: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
- station_settings.js:88 Error saving settings: SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input

## Root Cause
The frontend was making requests to '/api/station-admin/settings' but no backend route existed, causing the server to return HTML (404 page) instead of JSON.

## Solution Implemented
- [x] Added `getStationSettings` and `saveStationSettings` methods to `backend/controllers/stationController.js`
- [x] Added GET and POST routes for '/station-admin/settings' in `backend/routes/stationRoutes.js` with JWT authentication
- [x] Controller methods handle fetching and updating station openAt/closeAt times based on open24/startTime/endTime

## Follow-up Steps
- [ ] Test the station settings page to ensure loading and saving works without errors
- [ ] Verify that authentication works correctly for store admins
- [ ] Check that the settings are properly saved and retrieved from the database
