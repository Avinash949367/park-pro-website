# TODO: Move Filters to Filters Button Click in results.html

## Steps to Complete:
1. **Make Filters Button Functional**: Add JavaScript to the existing "Filters" button in the search header to toggle the visibility of the filters.
2. **Move Filters Below Search Header**: Relocate the filters-card div from the sidebar column (col-lg-3) to immediately after the search header section, and hide it by default.
3. **Style Filters as Collapsible Panel**: Update the filters-card to appear as a collapsible panel or dropdown below the search header when the Filters button is clicked.
4. **Remove Sidebar Column**: Eliminate the col-lg-3 div and adjust the results column (col-lg-9) to take full width (col-12).
5. **Ensure Responsiveness**: Add mobile-friendly styles for the collapsible filters panel.
6. **Test Layout and Functionality**: Verify the filters appear on button click instead of sidebar, and all controls work.
