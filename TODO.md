# TODO: Update users_view.html for Banned User Actions

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze users_view.html to understand modal structure and button rendering
- [x] Modify showUserDetailsModal function to conditionally show buttons based on user.banned status
- [x] Add Unban button with click handler for unbanning users
- [x] Ensure Delete button is always shown with full functionality
- [x] Update performUserAction function to handle 'unban' action
- [x] Test the changes (assuming backend supports unban endpoint)

## Notes
- Assumed user object has `banned` property (boolean)
- Unban action uses POST to `/api/admin/users/{userId}/unban`
- Modal now dynamically renders buttons based on user status
- All existing functionality for Ban, Disable, and Delete preserved for non-banned users
