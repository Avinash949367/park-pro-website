# FASTag Page Separation Task - UPDATED

## Overview
Divide FASTag functionality into two separate pages:
- One for FASTag ID generation (get-fastag.html)
- One for FASTag payment/recharge (fastag.html)
- Link them based on whether user has FASTag ID

## Steps Completed
- [x] Modify frontend/get-fastag.html to focus only on FASTag ID generation/application
- [x] Modify frontend/fastag.html to focus only on FASTag recharge/payment
- [x] Create frontend/js/fastagNavigation.js with navigation logic to check user profile for FASTag ID and redirect accordingly

## Remaining Steps
- [ ] Add script tags to HTML files to include navigation logic
- [ ] Test the flow: ID generation -> redirect to recharge; existing ID -> direct to recharge

## Files Created/Modified
- frontend/get-fastag.html (modified)
- frontend/fastag.html (modified)
- frontend/js/fastagNavigation.js (created)

## Backend
- No changes needed, use existing /profile endpoint to check fastagId
