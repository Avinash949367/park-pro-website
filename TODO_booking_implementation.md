- [x] Update slot_management.html: Change book slot modal to have user email and vehicle number inputs.
- [x] Update slot_management.js: Modify saveBooking() to send POST request to create booking instead of updating availability.
- [x] Update slot_management.html: Update view bookings modal to display past, ongoing, future bookings in sections.
- [x] Update slot_management.js: Modify viewBookings() to categorize bookings and render in sections.
